Code contained in this folder:

alphanate.m - this adds a 4th channel (alpha) to the image: it's just feathered around each edge.

computeH.m - takes two matrices of points, a source set and a destination set, and computes a homography that will warp between them

main.m - a scripty piece with a bunch of variables that will run the various parts of the assignment

refine.m - given a cpstruct (as comes out of cpselect) and the two related images, refine.m will search through patches around the images to ensure that they are really representative of the same point.

shiftImage.m - given an image and a shift, it returns a new image with that image as a subpiece, shifted by the desired amounts from the edges

stitchImages.m - takes 3 images and stitches them together into a single image, overlaying and summing alpha channels

warpImage.m - given an image and a homography, it warps the image by that matrix and returns it.  also returns the x and y shifts necessary to place the image correctly post-warp.
